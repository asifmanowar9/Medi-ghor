## Service Status

I'm currently experiencing difficulties connecting to the AI analysis services. I've captured your medical test report image but cannot perform a detailed analysis at this moment.

## Image Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Filename | ${filename} |
| Image Type | ${imageStats.format} |
| Dimensions | ${imageStats.width}Ã—${imageStats.height} |
| File Size | ${Math.round(imageStats.size / 1024)} KB |

## Recommendations

- Please try again in a few minutes as our analysis services may be temporarily unavailable
- Ensure the image is clear and all text is legible
- If the problem persists, you can discuss the report directly with your healthcare provider

## Next Steps

Your image has been saved and you can continue this conversation later when our services are available again.

> **Note:** This is a fallback response as our analysis services are currently experiencing technical difficulties. We apologize for the inconvenience.`;
